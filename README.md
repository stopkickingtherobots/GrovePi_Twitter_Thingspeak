# GrovePi_Twitter_Thingspeak

A small project I started to practice some IoT concepts.

The script collects temperature, humidity, light and sound data, then tweets to 
@GroveZeppelin and updates a public ThingSpeak channel https://thingspeak.com/channels/512403

Hardware

- Raspberry Pi running "Raspbian for Robots"
- GrovePi
	- Sound Sensor 
	- Light Sensor
